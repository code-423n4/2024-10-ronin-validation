## Missing validation for feeProtocolNum in enableFeeAmount() of KatanaV3Factory

### Vulnerability Detail
The function enableFeeAmount in the KatanaV3Factory contract does not check if feeProtocolNum is greater than zero. This could potentially allow a fee protocol ratio of 0/denominator, meaning no protocol fee will be collected.
The lack of validation for feeProtocolNum > 0 could result in the protocol unintentionally not collecting fees for certain pools.

### Recommendation:
Add a validation check for feeProtocolNum to ensure it is greater than zero when enabling a fee amount.

`require(feeProtocolNum > 0, "KatanaV3Factory: FEE_PROTOCOL_NUM_MUST_BE_GREATER_THAN_ZERO");`
